# Customer_churn_prediction
Predicting customer churn using Linear Regression and Naive Bayes models in Google Colab, with full data preprocessing, model evaluation, and comparison.

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression and Naive Bayes, all implemented in Google Colab.

Overview

Customer churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to stop using their services. Accurately predicting churn can lead to targeted customer retention strategies and improved business performance.

In this project:

We explore a customer dataset.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
Build predictive models using Linear Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers.
Evaluate and compare model performances.
Tools Used

Python
Google Colab (for coding and execution)
Pandas (for data handling)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
Models Implemented

Linear Regression: Used here for a basic predictive benchmark, even though it is typically suited for continuous outputs.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier that works well for categorical churn prediction.
Steps

Import the necessary libraries.
Load and explore the dataset.
Handle missing values and preprocess the data.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train models using Linear Regression and Naive Bayes.
Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, and recall.
Compare the results and discuss model effectiveness.
How to Run

Open Google Colab.
Upload the notebook file (.ipynb) or copy the code into a new notebook.
Ensure necessary libraries are installed (!pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn if needed).
Upload your dataset (or load it directly if hosted online).
Run the cells sequentially to train and evaluate models.
Dataset

You can use any churn dataset, for example:

Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle
Results

After evaluating the models, we observed:

Linear Regression gave reasonable predictive power but is less suitable due to churn being a classification task.
Naive Bayes provided better classification metrics and was more effective in predicting churn.
Conclusion

Naive Bayes is more appropriate for churn prediction in this scenario.
Further improvements can be made using more complex models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks.
Future Work

Hyperparameter tuning.
Feature engineering for better predictive power.
Testing with additional algorithms.
Building an interactive dashboard to monitor churn predictions.
